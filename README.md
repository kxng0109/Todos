How it works:

-Tap/Click on the check icon to save your entry.

-Tap/Click on the checkbox to mark your entry as completed or not completed.

-Tap/Click the pencil icon to edit the content in that particular entry.

-Tap/Click on the entry to expand it's content or close it's content.

-Tap/Click on the trash icon to delete your entry(You can't recover it when you delete it, unless you quickly close the tab).

-Tap/Click the slider at the top-right of the page to toggle between dark mode and light mode.

Thank you.
